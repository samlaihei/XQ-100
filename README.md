# XQ-100
 Sample of bright quasars between 3.5 < z < 4.5 from __[Lopez+2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...594A..91L/abstract)__. 
 The reduced, flux-calibrated, and post-processed spectra are 
 available in this repository, alongside XQ100_properties.fits, which is a file that contains
 the spectroscopic redshifts and measured CIV/MgII/Hbeta line properties of QSOs in the sample.
 We also provide example line models for the measured line properties, which are presented in an upcoming paper.
 
 For the spectral data fits files, there are only three columns:

- Wavelength: observed frame wavelength in units of angstroms
- Flux: observed frame flux in units of erg/s/cm2/angstrom
- eFlux: observed frame flux standard deviation error in the same units as the Flux column
